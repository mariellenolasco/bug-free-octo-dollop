# Programming Basics

Programming is a lot like recipe making. In fact, there exists a programming language called chef that creates programs through recipes! It's mainly all about telling your computer what to do and when to do it. Programming requires you to think in a very step by step manner. It also makes you consider certain things we might take forgranted as humans because we know how to infer from context. But computers can't! Keeping in mind that you're telling an excited rock what to do helps in keeping your patience when your code doesn't work.

## Variables

Variables are references to the data you have in memory. Computer memory is not very human readable, and remembering exact memory addresses should not be your responsibility as a developer. So variables are there to remember where the memory spaces are, all you have to remember is the variable name.

With strongly typed lanuages like Java and C#, you have to remember to bind your variable to a data type. Strongly typed languages check the data type of the variable during compile time and run time.

**Declaring Variables in Java**:

    Datatype variableName = new DataTypeConstructor();

    Ex: Object newObject = new Object();

There are certain data types called primitives that don't need the new key word when you instantiate it.

    Ex: int number = 5;
        bool isPrimitive = true;
